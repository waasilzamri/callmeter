== What are these bill modes? ==

xx/yy means the first xx seconds are billed. no matter how long the call takes.
the next billing periods are yy seconds long.

some examples:
 # a call with a duration of 45s is billed as
   * 60s with 60/yy
   * 45s with 30/1
   * 50s with 30/10
   * 30s with 30/0
 # a call with a duration of 65s is billed as
   * 60s with 60/0
   * 65s with xx/1
   * 70s with xx/10
   * 120s with 60/60

==How does this whole thing work?==
Basically there are 3 parts to understand:
 # There is the LogRunner running in background every now and then collecting information from your device and storing them in a database.
 # There are Plans. This is where you set cost, limits, bill modes etc.
 # There are Rules. These rules define, which log is billed in which plan to show up on may screen.

==How do I exclude a few numbers from a plan?==
 # Go to the Rules view.
 # Look for "exclude numbergroups".
 # Add/Edit a numbergroup:
   * Add all numbers you want to be excluded to the group
   * Wildcards are allowd. E.g. add +491% and 01% to exclude all German mobile numbers.
 # Go back to the rule and select the created the number group.
